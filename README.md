# BCIOT
This mechanism selects the proxy nodes of each blockchain in multiple blockchains, and passes the ID of the proxy node as the public key to the cross-chain notary. Then the cross-chain notary calculates the corresponding private key through IBE encryption algorithm, and returns it to the proxy node in a secure way, so as to achieve safe and efficient communication between blockchains. IBE-BCIOT mechanism provides two cross-chain communication schemes: direct cross-chain communication scheme of the proxy node and the indirect cross-chain communication scheme of the notary.


# Code
This Code is a demo of the project, whose main purpose is to show the implementation process of indirect communication and direct communication based on IOT. We are sorting out more codes. After sorting out, we will upload the complete project codes to the current webpage for updating.
